                        <p>
In Game Design and Development - 200, I was apart of a eight person team where we created a video game titled @Obsession using Unity. I was a programmer on the project and I was responsible for creating and developing the interactive computer-streaming system using within the game. The game had a psychological-horror theme where the general premise was that you were a streamer trying to prevent a stalker from harming you. The computer-streaming system I created was used to directly interact with the player, as messages from the stalker would come through and you had options on how to respond, which would influence the ending of the game. This video game was presented at University of Wisconsin-Stout's Fall 2023 game expo and was very well recieved.

				In Game Design and Development - 325, I created my first Game Jam game. I worked in a group with five other individuals where we created Gruesome Fish. I was a programmer on the jam and I was responsible for creating and devleoping the human script and functionality. The game was used as a learning oppertunity to learn how to work in a scrum-style environment and the game ended up presenting very well during our presentation.

                        <p>
				In Programming in Game Engines, I had the oppurtunity to create a project using Godot game engine. 
				My primary focus was on learning the engine as well as GDScript, and I had a really enjoyable time learning those two things. 
				I chose to create a platformer game where you play as a ninja frog collecting pinneaples and defeating chickens. 
				I designed the game mechanics, including character movement and enemy AI, through singletons and state machines.

                        <p>
		          In Game Design and Development - 100, I, along with three other individuals, created a board game titled Silver Asylum. I was the Project Manager for this project, and I worked with my team to create a horror-esque board game where you escaped an Asylum. I was responsible for delegating tasks, making sure everyone followed deadlines, and also aided in the development of the rules for the game. This board game was presented at University of Wisconsin-Stout's Fall 2022 game expo and preformed well.

			   I created a remake of the classic Asteroids game using python through GlowScript, which focuses on 3D physics simulations.
			   The goal was to create engaging looping gameplay and to continue to develop my game development skills. I also was able to
			   create a good majority of my functions through physics equations, which allowed me to develop my physics knowledge.

                        <p>
				In my Database Systems class, I developed a library database system using MySQL to manage a collection of Taylor Swift songs. 
				The objective was to create a user-friendly interface that allowed users to add, delete, and sort songs efficently by album, genre, and version.
				I designed the database schema by defining tables for the attributes and allowed users to use queries and buttons to easily edit and sort the collection.
